### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Luna. I love finding ways to combine technology and art. I strive to train myself in having both artistic and technical skills and finding inventive ways to combine these skills. I've started out as a pixel artist, and I love to push that medium with a variety of technologies.

I'm currently graduating the Utrecht School of the Arts!
